# MC3DS-Translator
- Translates any BJSON Language into any other language that isn't supported in-game.
- Is not the most accurate translator tool around. But is MUCH better and faster than manually typing in Translations by-hand.

## Features:
- Auto translate from any language in-game to any other language if the language-code is provided.
- Not the best translation tool, but is far faster and generally gets the job done for Translating Text.
